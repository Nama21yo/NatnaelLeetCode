Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:
​
The time complexity is
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
+
𝑚
log
⁡
𝑚
)
O(nlogn+mlogm) due to the sorting of the players and trainers arrays.
The matching process itself is
𝑂
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
O(n+m), as each element of both arrays is processed at most once.
Space Complexity:
​
The space complexity is
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) as no additional space proportional to the input size is used beyond a few variables.
This implementation efficiently matches players with trainers based on their skill levels, ensuring that the maximum number of players is matched with suitable trainers.
