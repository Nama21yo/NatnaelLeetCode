Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:
​
The time complexity is
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑚
)
O(nlogm), where
𝑛
n is the number of piles, and
𝑚
m is the maximum number of bananas in a pile. This is because the binary search runs in
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑚
)
O(logm) and for each iteration, the isPossible function runs in
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n).
Space Complexity:
​
The space complexity is
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
This implementation ensures an efficient and correct solution for finding the minimum eating speed Koko should use to finish all the bananas within the given hours.
