O(1), considering the space used for the pointers and variables.
​
In-place Merging: The function merges the lists in-place without using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.
Constant Extra Space: It uses a few extra variables (e.g., dummy, current, list1, list2), which do not depend on the size of the input lists. Therefore, the space complexity is
