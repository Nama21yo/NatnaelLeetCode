Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:
​
The time complexity is
𝑂
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
O(n+m), where n and m are the lengths of the input lists l1 and l2, respectively. Each node is processed exactly once.
Space Complexity:
​
The space complexity is
𝑂
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
O(n+m) due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion will be equal to the total number of nodes in both lists.
